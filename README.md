# React Native V8 JSI adapter
A V8 adapter implemention of the JSI interface for the react-native framework.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ms/v8-jsi/_apis/build/status/microsoft.v8-jsi?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ms/v8-jsi/_build/latest?definitionId=321&branchName=master)

## Building
Run ./localbuild.ps1 in a PowerShell terminal; by default, this will only build the win32 x64 release version of the binary. Edit the file to specify other platforms, architectures or flavors.

### Out-of-sync issues
Until the JSI headers find a more suitable home, they're currently duplicated between the various repos. Code in jsi\jsi should be synchronized with the matching version of JSI from react-native (from https://github.com/facebook/hermes/tree/master/API/jsi/jsi).

### Build script patches
To regenerate after manual fix-ups, run `git diff --output=..\..\..\..\scripts\patch\build.diff --ignore-cr-at-eol` from `\build\v8build\v8\build\`.
And `git diff --output=..\..\..\scripts\patch\src.diff --ignore-cr-at-eol` from `\build\v8build\v8\`.
